## You have just found ERU.

High Level Framework for PyTorch

Currently the Framework is under active developing and the first version will be ready before summer 2018. 

Eru is designed to help with Deep Learning developer to try out advanced models efficiently, so we recommend users to have some understanding of deep learning before using. For this reason, Eru is only implement on GPUs, but we will build CPU configuration soon. 

## Quick Start
Comming Soon

We are writing a detailed version of the documentation and tutorial...

## Examples
We have several illustrative examples ranging from basic MLP to sentiment classifiers in the [example folder](https://github.com/Shawn-Shan/Eru/tree/master/examples)

## Want to contribute?
We welcome anyone who have some python or pytorch experience to join us. More information in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Shawn-Shan/eru/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
